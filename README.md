BookStore Project

The current project provide simple <b>CRUD</b> API that works with Book Store (as an example)

As a database, I'm using a generic List type.

The provided repository interface could be used to implement connection with any data store <u><b>(SQL or NoSQL or Text file doesn't matter)<b/><u/>
